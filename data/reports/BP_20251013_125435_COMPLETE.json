        "full_text": "Total US consumer spending accounts for over $14 trillion annually and two-thirds of the US GDP. An important subset of this spending goes toward everyday consumer packaged goods (CPG), ranging from foods and beverages to cosmetics and cleaning products. The sheer size of the CPG sector\u2014with millions of employees and trillions of dollars in annual sales\u2014makes it a critical component in efforts to build a more sustainable, inclusive economy.\n\nAbout the authors This article is a collaborative effort by Sherry Frey of NielsenIQ and Jordan Bar Am, Vinit Doshi, Anandi Malik, and Steve Noble, representing views from McKinsey\u2019s Consumer Packaged Goods Practice.\n\nCPG companies increasingly allocate time, attention, and resources to instill environmental and social responsibility into their business practices. They are also making claims about environmental and social responsibility on their product labels. The results have been evident: walk down the aisle of any grocery or drugstore these days and you\u2019re bound to see products labeled \u201cenvironmentally sustainable,\u201d \u201ceco-friendly,\u201d \u201cfair trade,\u201d or other designations related to aspects of environmental and social responsibility. Most important is what lies behind these product claims\u2014the actual contribution of such business practices to achieving goals such as reducing carbon emissions across value chains, offering fair wages and working practices to employees, and supporting diversity and inclusion. But understanding how customers respond to social and environmental claims is also important and has not been clear in the past.\n\nWhen consumers are asked if they care about buying environmentally and ethically sustainable products, they overwhelmingly answer yes: in a 2020 McKinsey US consumer sentiment survey, more than 60 percent of respondents said they\u2019d pay more for a product with sustainable packaging. A recent study by NielsenIQ found that 78 percent of US consumers say that a sustainable lifestyle is important to them. Yet many CPG executives report that one challenge to their companies\u2019 environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives is the inability to generate sufficient consumer demand for these products. There are many stories of companies launching new products incorporating ESG-related claims only to find that sales fell short of expectations.\n\nHow can both of these things be true? Do consumers really care whether products incorporate ESG-related claims? Do shoppers follow through and buy these products while standing in front of store shelves or browsing online? Do their real-life buying decisions diverge from their stated preferences? The potential costs\u2014particularly in an inflationary context\u2014of manufacturing and certifying products that make good on ESG-related claims are high. Accurately assessing demand for products that make these claims is vital as companies think about where to make ESG-related investments across their businesses. Companies should therefore be eager to better understand whether and how these types of claims influence consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions. Is a shopper more likely to purchase a product if there\u2019s an ESG-related claim printed on its package? What about multiple claims? Are some kinds of claims more resonant than others? Does a claim matter more if it\u2019s appended to a pricier product? Is it less meaningful if it comes from a big, established brand?\n\nOver the past several months, McKinsey and NielsenIQ undertook an extensive study seeking to answer these and other questions. We looked beyond the self-reported intentions of US consumers and examined their actual spending behavior\u2014tracking dollars instead of sentiment. The result, for CPG companies, is a fact-based case for bringing environmentally and socially responsible products to market as part of overall ESG strategies and commitments. Creating such products turns out to be not just a moral imperative but also a solid business decision.\n\nProducts making ESG-related claims averaged 28 percent cumulative growth over the past five-year period, versus 20 percent for products that made no such claims.\n\nTo be clear, this is only a first step in understanding the complex question of how consumers value brands and products that incorporate ESG-related claims. This work has significant limitations that merit mention at the outset.\n\nFirst, although this study examines how the sales growth of products that feature ESG-related claims fared relative to similar products without such claims, it does not demonstrate a causal relationship that definitively indicates whether consumers bought these brands because of the ESG-related claims or for other reasons. For instance, the study does not control for factors such as marketing investments, distribution, and promotional activity. It primarily explores the correlation between ESG-related claims and sales performance.\n\nSecond, McKinsey and NielsenIQ did not attempt to independently assess the veracity of ESG-related claims for th",

But our journey from 50 years ago to today hasn\u2019t been perfect. Like many large environmental organizations and much like the mainstream environmental movement in the United States, Greenpeace USA has continual work to do to ensure justice is at the core of our campaigns.\n\n\n\nWhat is Environmental Justice?\n\nEnvironmental Justice is a concept that was coined in the early 1960s during the Civil Rights movement and has increasingly picked up momentum as our social justice movements and environmental issues have grown. The issues of racism and socioeconomic justice are central to the issue of Environmental Justice. At its core, Environmental Justice guarantees that all people have equal access to a healthy, safe, and sustainable environment, as well as equal protection from environmental harm.\n\nEnvironmental Justice assumes and recognizes community care and Indigenous and first nations\u2019 knowledge. It acknowledges how privilege, power, and oppression are integral to our understanding of how we are impacted by climate change and our environment.\n\nWe witness environmental injustice when our single-use plastic is incinerated causing air pollution in low-income communities in the US, or when it is shipped overseas to overwhelm South East Asian communities. We witness environmental injustice in Flint, MI, a majority-black community that still has lead in its water and when state violence harms Indigenous youth fighting to protect their land. These are only a few examples of the impact of environmental injustice that highlight the necessity of centering Environmental Justice in our movement.\n\nClimate Justice Means Migrant Justice\n\nClimate change is not just about rising temperatures or stronger storms \u2014 it\u2019s about people. Entire communities are being displaced, livelihoods are disappearing and families are being forced to make impossible choices. As ecosystems shift, people must too. But how we respond \u2014 whether with compassion and humanity or fear and hate \u2014 will determine the scale of human suffering. This is why climate justice is migrant justice.\n\nClimate Change is Forcing Migration\n\nAs fires raged through Los Angeles, more than 100,000 people were forced to flee their homes \u2014 many of whom will never return. Dozens lost their lives. This is not an isolated event. Human-caused climate change has made California hotter, drier, and more fire-prone, with devastating consequences. Across the U.S., Americans are increasingly citing climate change as a reason for relocating. Globally, millions are being displaced by climate disasters every year.\n\nThe communities most affected by climate migration are often those least responsible for the crisis. Many of those forced to leave their homes are from the Global South \u2014 regions that have historically contributed the least to carbon emissions but bear the brunt of climate consequences. Meanwhile, wealthier nations, which have historically emitted the most greenhouse gases, often shut their doors to those seeking refuge from climate disaster.\n\nClimate migrants often face a legal void \u2014 many countries including the United States do not recognize climate displacement as a valid reason for asylum. Without legal protections, climate refugees are left vulnerable to exploitation, detention, and deportation. Climate justice means acknowledging that migration is a necessary adaptation strategy and ensuring that those displaced by climate change are met with compassion and rights-based policies, not criminalization.\n\nWho\u2019s Responsible\n\nDespite overwhelming evidence, Big Oil executives and their political allies continue to deny, deflect, and profit. For over a half-century, oil and gas companies have known that burning fossil fuels would accelerate climate disasters. Instead of taking responsibility, they covered it up, spent billions lobbying against climate action, and bankrolled politicians like President Trump who now blame migrants for economic instability instead of corporate greed.\n\nIt\u2019s not an accident that the same politicians that spread hate and fear \u2013 demonizing, detaining, and deporting migrants \u2013 are also opening the floodgates for fossil fuel expansion. The more they can convince us to point the finger at each other, the less we can unite to hold those truly responsible to account.\n\nWhy is justice critical to the future of activism?\n\nAs our planet continues to warm, forest fires burn, plastics dump into our oceans, and natural disasters worsen, we are witnessing increases in negative impacts. Our movements must keep pac",

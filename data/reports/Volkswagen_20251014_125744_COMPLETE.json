Despite having launched the most ambitious decarbonization and digitalization initiative in automotive history, the Volkswagen Group (VW), the world\u2019s largest automaker by volume, had a market cap well below that of its rivals. VW realized they needed to better articulate their ESG strategy.\n\nTo address this, the auto major wanted to implement a more cohesive sustainability narrative\u2014from environmental to diversity to human rights and resource efficiency\u2014that would resonate with its culture and its individual brands. VW also wanted to sharpen its overall ESG focus, defining the initiatives, responsibilities and KPIs that would make sustainability synonymous with the corporate strategy.\n\nAchieving this would clarify its sustainability strategy\u2014to become an emission-free, digitally-connected leader in mobility\u2014and drive greater awareness among stakeholders, including the investment community.\n\nWhen tech meets human ingenuity\n\nAccenture broke the project into three phases. Phase one involved determining where VW stood in relation to its peers. Since investors trust S-Ray, a machine learning platform that generates ESG ratings of companies based on millions of data points for over 7,000 listed companies, the team identified the data needed to generate an S-Ray score and ESG rating in line with VW\u2019s industry-leading efforts.\n\nNext, the team conducted C-level workshops to develop support for the company\u2019s ESG vision, emphasizing decarbonization, circular business models, workforce transformation and human rights in supply chain. The third phase saw the team help articulate VW\u2019s ESG narrative, which included key initiatives, responsibilities, KPIs and a plan to communicate all the company\u2019s efforts.",

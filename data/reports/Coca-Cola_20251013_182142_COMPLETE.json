The goals also include sustainable use of energy and packaging, as well as sustainable sourcing of agricultural products used in Coca-Cola\u00b4s manufacturing processes. At the same time, Coca-Cola intends to cut carbon dioxide emissions embedded in every single drink by 25% and aims to achieve a 75% recovery rate of bottles and cans in developed markets by 2020.\n\nMuhtar Kent, chairman and chief executive officer of the Coca-Cola Company, commented that the company was firmly committed to addressing environmental challenges and together with its partners will be seeking to manage the world\u00b4s natural resources wisely and responsibly.\n\nCarter Roberts, president and chief executive of the WWF, stated that natural resources around the world were under unprecedented pressure as the global population increases. It is the responsibility of businesses to make sure that their own existence is not put at risk by exhaustion of resources. Environmental challenges can be addressed only by working together, he added.\n\nNew targets will also be set for Coca-Cola\u00b4s almost 300 different bottling partners in 200 countries around the world, the company announced.",

        "full_text": "Tesla has been a leader in the electric vehicles space for years, but just how green is Tesla?\n\nAt LeafScore, our top concern is how our purchasing decisions impact climate change. That encompasses what we wear, how we cook, and what we drive. Surprise! We\u2019re fond of electric vehicles. But even EVs vary in their sustainability. Here\u2019s our updated deep dive into how sustainable Tesla is as a company.\n\nTop line takeaway Tesla earns top marks for some areas of sustainability, but there\u2019s room for improvement, based on the company\u2019s latest Impact Report.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2023, Tesla customers avoided more than 20 million metric tons of CO2e emissions. That\u2019s comparable to about 51 billion miles of driving an ICEV. This is thanks to folks driving Tesla EVs and using its energy storage and solar panels.\n\nTesla EVs are more sustainable than ICE vehicles\n\nPurely based on lifetime greenhouse gas emissions, a Tesla is more sustainable than a comparable ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicle.\n\nYes, initial carbon emissions during manufacturing are higher for EVs than ICE vehicles, mainly because of the battery pack, but data suggests that an EV can reach parity with an ICE vehicle within just 6 months if powered by renewables alone.\n\nEven if you charge your EV from the grid (assuming a mix of renewables and fossil fuels), it will reach parity within 1-5 years.\n\nTesla itself estimates a carbon \u2018payback period\u2019 of around three years, after which a Tesla\u2019s lifetime emissions will be lower than a comparable ICE vehicle.\n\nTesla Model Y is the most efficient electric SUV on the road The Model Y All-Wheel Drive (AWD) gets 3.8 EPA miles/kWh. Closest is the Kia EV8, which achieves 3.6 miles/kW.\n\nNotable from the 2023 Impact Report:\n\nTesla\u2019s overall GHG emissions rose from 2021 through 2023\n\nBut\n\nEmissions per vehicle manufactured went down 29% from 2021 to 2022\n\nEmissions per vehicle decreased another 10% from 2022 to 2023.\n\nMost cars in the U.S. have a lifespan of 17 years. Driving a Tesla for this long will help you avoid about 51 tons of C02e, according to Tesla. This is a conservative estimate though, assuming no decrease in fuel efficiency for an ICE vehicle and no increase in renewables in the electrical grid.\n\nIt\u2019s also likely that the CO2 emissions from manufacturing EVs will decrease over time, as processes become more efficient and more battery recycling occurs. Tesla is ahead of the game on this front, with robust recycling programs already in place and increasing efficiencies in battery technology.\n\nAverage Lifecycle Emissions of a Tesla\n\nCurrent grid (c2023) \u2013 United States gCO2e/mi* Shift to greener grid \u2013 New York gCO2e/mi* Model 3/Y* \u2013 Solar charged 72 72 Model 3/Y* \u2013 Grid charged 116 108 Average ICE vehicle 445 445\n\n*Standard Range (RWD)\n\nTesla makes more sustainable batteries\n\nThere\u2019s no avoiding the fact that EV battery production generates far more emissions than manufacturing an ICE vehicle. Around 40-50% of GHGs produced making an EV are due to the batteries.\n\nProducing the battery for a Tesla generates between 5,291 and 35,273 pounds of CO2 emissions. That\u2019s about three times higher than the emissions to manufacture a gas-powered car.\n\nThe good news for Tesla fans is that the company acknowledges this problem and has taken steps to reduce GHGs from battery production. One key strategy is using a dryelectrode process to manufacture battery cells. This reduces energy use by more than 70%, without compromising battery quality.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s highly unlikely you\u2019ll need to replace a Tesla battery, which also makes Teslas more sustainable.\n\nElectricity is getting greener all the time Emissions per mile will only improve for EVs as the grid gets greener. This won\u2019t happen to ICE vehicles as burning fossil fuels inevitably releases GHGs.\n\nLonger battery life\n\nTesla has been making EVs for more than 10 years and its internal data shows very little battery degradation over time. Here\u2019s how your Tesla battery is likely to look after 200,000 miles, which is the typical mileage at which a vehicle is scrapped in the U.S.:\n\nAverage battery capacity after 200,000 miles Model 3 85% Model Y 85% Model S 88% Model X 88%\n\nIn addition, since its introduction in 2012, the Model S range has increased by more than 50%. Tesla has achieved this without vastly increasing the battery size in its EVs.\n\nWhat about Tesla's brake and tire pollution? EV critics love to suggest that electric vehicles are heavier than ICEV, thus creating more brake and tire pollution from greater wear and tear. Is this true? Nope. We bust that myth here.\n\nTesla\u2019s transition to vegan leather\n\nIn response to ethical concerns raised by customers and PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), Tesla stopped using real leather in all of its cars in 2016 and now uses vegan leather.\n\nVegan leather has several advantages over animal leather. For instance, it is:\n\nLighter (this is why airlines love it!)\n\nStronger, more resilient, and more durable\n\nPotentially les",

        "full_text": "As you\u2019ll realise every time your phone runs out of juice, batteries have become fundamental to how we communicate.\n\nNow they could be about to transform how we get our energy too.\n\nWhen Elon Musk launched Tesla\u2019s home battery system one year ago, he promised \u201ca fundamental transformation in how energy is delivered across the Earth\u201d. He is now building a \u201cgigafactory\u201d in the desert with an ambition to manufacture more batteries by 2020 every year than the whole world produced in 2013.\n\nMusk isn\u2019t alone. Big names from Gates to Dyson are now competing in a billion dollar race to discover the next lucrative breakthrough that could revolutionise the energy system.\n\nThe technology is changing fast. The cost of lithium-ion batteries \u2013 the most common type \u2013 plunged by 53% between 2012 and 2015 and are predicted to half again by 2019, according to energy analysts IHS. It\u2019s estimated that storage could help to bring about a saving of \u00a38bn to British consumers, secure energy supply for a generation and meet carbon targets.\n\nBut what would this \u201cfundamental transformation\u201d look like? We put the question to some self-confessed battery geeks.\n\nWe could run our own mini power stations \u2013 and sell electricity to our neighbours\n\n\u201cThis is the future,\u201d claimed Welsh householder Mark Kerr as he proudly unveiled his Tesla home battery system in February this year \u2013 the first of its kind to be installed in the country \u2013 which allows him to use the energy from his solar panels when the sun isn\u2019t shining.\n\nBy enabling householders to use their own supply 24 hours a day, cheap energy storage could be \u201cthe final piece in the global energy transition puzzle,\u201d to use the words of top financial ratings agency Standard and Poor\u2019s.\n\nThe public could then become not just energy consumers, but energy producers, like Kerr, with each home effectively running their own individual power stations.\n\nWidespread take-up of batteries could even see neighbours trading electricity between themselves. It\u2019s unlikely to look like this though:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting that you would be sitting there on your front lawn selling electricity. You\u2019d do it all through smart technology,\u201d says Dr Jill Cainey, director of the Electricity Storage Network, which brings together organisations that deploy, design and research storage.\n\n\u201cYou would set the price you\u2019re willing to buy at and sell at and there would be a local agent who would look after that for you,\u201d says Cainey.\n\nThis could save money for consumers and carbon emissions because the 7-10% of electricity wasted in transmission through long centralised lines that connect them to the grid would be saved.\n\nIn fact, individual consumers are already starting to trade with each other via sonnencommunities \u2013 an online network in Germany that enables those with battery systems to trade energy with each other \u2013 but as users are not based in the same physical locality they don\u2019t stand to benefit in this way.\n\nIt could bankrupt the National Grid and lead to rising inequality\n\nBattery geeks call it \u201cthe death spiral\u201d. As more and more people go off grid, spurred on by the potential of storage to provide them with electricity day and night, the National Grid faces a rising problem \u2013 who will pay the costs of their system? At the moment these costs are incorporated into our energy bills.\n\n\u201cWe could become lots of isolated units looking after ourselves and the burden of the wires and transformers will fall on those less able to invest so the costs will be spread over fewer and fewer people,\u201d says Cainey.\n\nThe prospect of the death spiral could upturn the way we pay for our energy.\n\nInstead of paying a flat rate on the energy you consume, in the future we could instead pay a one-time \u201cinsurance fee\u201d to connect to the grid for the times when our personal energy systems experience a blackout, if plans being mooted by energy regulator Ofgem become reality.\n\nAnd spell trouble for the Big Six\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t continue to operate on the business model they currently have,\u201d says Cainey.\n\nAs more and more people start to produce their own energy, large-scale generators are losing custom to individuals and communities who are going off-grid.\n\nThis is already causing them problems. In Germany, where community energy projects are more common, energy prices went negative during a particularly sunny and windy May day and firms had to pay consumers to use electricity.\n\n\u201cYou could think of big six as being the dinosaurs of the electricity industry. They\u2019ve either got to evolve very rapidly or they will become extinct. The real driver is that we can now generate electricity ourselves and the role of batteries is to maximise the amount of our generation we can use,\u201d adds Cainey.\n\nIt could also fight fuel poverty\n\nIt might seem that those with less money have far less to gain from the great future battery revolution. But if somebody can be found to purchase the infrastructure, it could help poorer people to save significant amounts on their ene",

        "full_text": "Imagining Labour\u2019s energy policy over the next five years is \u2013 to put it bluntly \u2013 a little confusing.\n\nThe new leader, veteran left-winger Jeremy Corbyn, is best known for claims he wants to nationalise things \u2013 and he does \u2013 yet when you read his \u201cenvironmental manifesto\u201d the word \u2018nationalise\u2019 doesn\u2019t appear.\n\nInstead it\u2019s all about devolving power (in all senses of the word) to communities, businesses and local government.\n\nIndeed speaking to me about his ambition for tens of thousands of rooftop solar panels, Corbyn said \u201cit is simply not credible or possible to make that into a mass public corporation.\u201d\n\nIn short the manifesto is about the sort of things you\u2019d expect his new Energy Secretary Lisa Nandy \u2013 and many other parts of the party \u2013 to be keen on.\n\nWriting in the Guardian, alongside Corbyn\u2019s leadership rival Liz Kendall, Nandy claimed that the \u201cnew Labour politics of the state is about putting power in the hands of people\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe must champion the power of human beings to shape their own lives, and oppose the tyranny of the bureaucratic state,\u201d added the new Shadow Energy Secretary whose background is more in tackling poverty than climate change.\n\nYet alongside the emphasis on social justice there is a strong \u2018green\u2019 component to Corbyn\u2019s support base \u2013 which attracted the support of Green MP Caroline Lucas \u2013 even if his actual policies sometimes fail to live up to the billing.\n\nGreen tension\n\nHow the tension between the green and red strands and the centralising and decentralising tendencies plays out will be crucial to defining not just Corbyn\u2019s own agenda but possibly an entirely new energy and climate consensus.\n\nIt could be a total mess, simply a proposal to add to the existing quagmire by spending billions on nationalising old coal plants nobody wants or needs anymore. But there is a chance for something new.\n\nIt starts where the consensus currently is. That to have a chance of playing its part in avoiding the worst impacts of climate change, the UK needs to generate almost all of its power cleanly within 15 years.\n\nTo do that, the country probably needs to cut down on fossil fuel exploration in its own backyard \u2013 fracking, for example, makes little sense unless the Gulf states can be convinced to cut down on their own gas production. Asking them to do so, whilst refusing to do so ourselves is intellectually legitimate \u2013 but may make for a poor negotiating position.\n\nAnd so things start to diverge from where we our now.\n\nThe current direction of policy (in as much as there is one) is basically about very big stuff being built by very big companies backed by big money on big returns with big(ish) bills for consumers.\n\nThe power produced by existing coal, gas and nuclear plants are to be replaced with a new fleet of nuclear power stations, coal \u2013 with the carbon dioxide captured and buried \u2013 and huge arrays of offshore wind turbines.\n\nDecentralised generation\n\nSmaller scale renewables \u2013 such as onshore wind and solar \u2013 will play a role, but far less of one than in other advanced European economies.\n\nBut that order could be reversed.\n\nSmaller scale renewables,owned by communities, households or even local governments (what Corbyn quaintly calls \u2018municipal ownership\u2019), would be the focus.\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t just mean direct support for tens \u2013 maybe hundreds \u2013 of thousands of homeowners, farms and businesses to put solar panels on every bit of roof they own.\n\nIt\u2019s also about larger projects backed by communities, co-operatives, local councils or small businesses.\n\nBack to the Victorian model?\n\nThink wind farms in Somerset owned by the local council \u2013 or Bristol city. It\u2019s a vision which harks back to the days before nationalisation, to the way things were back in the Victorian era.\n\nBut empowering households and cities only takes you so far. The legacy of the Victorians \u2013 and industrialisation \u2013 is that there will always be arguments over what proportion of the UK\u2019s countryside can be given over to energy generation.\n\nThis is not a concern on which the right has a monopoly.\n\nToo many solar farms\n\nEven Corbyn says he finds it sad \u201cwhen I see farmland taken over to be given into solar generation thus using crop space or grazing space.\u201d You still need some big stuff producing energy more efficiently over a smaller area \u2013 or just far out to sea.\n\nThat means large offshore wind farms, giant tidal projects, nuclear or coal plants with facilities to try and capture the carbon dioxide they create.\n\nIn the current set-up though these are built, owned and operated by the utilities \u2013 the same firms Corbyn has threatened to nationalise.\n\nBut whilst that may have been the solution for the left in post-Victorian times \u2013 when the power stations had recently been built \u2013 it would be a curious option now. Why would the government want to buy a bunch of ageing coal and nuclear plants it is looking to close? Even the energy companies themselves don\u2019t really want to own them.\n\nThe more realistic option is common owner",

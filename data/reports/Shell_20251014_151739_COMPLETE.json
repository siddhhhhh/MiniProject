        "full_text": "Business framework\n\nEnvironmental, social, and governance (ESG) is shorthand for an investing principle that prioritizes environmental issues, social issues, and corporate governance.[1] Investing with ESG considerations is sometimes referred to as responsible investing or, in more proactive cases, impact investing.[1] The term is also frequently used interchangeably with corporate social responsibility and sustainability[2], although these concepts have different foci, origins and applications.[3]\n\nThe term ESG first came to prominence in a 2004 report titled \"Who Cares Wins\", which was a joint initiative of financial institutions at the invitation of the United Nations (UN).[4] By 2023, the ESG movement had grown from a UN corporate social responsibility initiative into a global phenomenon representing more than US$30 trillion in assets under management.[5]\n\nCriticisms of ESG vary depending on viewpoint and area of focus. These areas include data quality and a lack of standardization; evolving regulation and politics; greenwashing; and variety in the definition and assessment of social good.[6] Some critics argue that ESG serves as a de facto extension of governmental regulation, with large investment firms like BlackRock imposing ESG standards that governments cannot or do not directly legislate.[7] This has led to accusations that ESG creates a mechanism for influencing markets and corporate behavior without democratic oversight, raising concerns about accountability and overreach.[8][9]\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nInvestment decisions are predominantly based on the potential for financial returns for a given level of risk.[10] However, there have always been many other criteria for deciding where to place money\u2014from political considerations to heavenly reward.[11]\n\nIn the 1970s, the worldwide abhorrence of the apartheid regime in South Africa led to one of the most renowned examples of selective disinvestment along ethical lines. As a response to a growing call for sanctions against the regime, the Reverend Leon Sullivan, a board member of General Motors in the United States, drew up a Code of Conduct in 1977 for practising business with South Africa.[11] What became known as the Sullivan Principles (Sullivan Code) attracted a great deal of attention. Several reports were commissioned by the government to examine how many US companies were investing in South African businesses that were contravening the Sullivan Code. The conclusions of the reports led to mass disinvestment by the US from many South African companies. The resulting pressure applied to the South African regime by its business community added great weight to the growing impetus for the system of apartheid to be abandoned.[12]\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the economist Milton Friedman, in response to the prevailing mood of philanthropy, argued that social responsibility adversely affects a firm's financial performance and that regulation and interference from \"big government\" will always damage the macro economy.[13] His contention that the valuation of a company or asset should be predicated almost exclusively on the financial bottom line (with the costs incurred by social responsibility being deemed non-essential) was prevalent for most of the 20th century (see Friedman doctrine). Towards the end of the 20th century, however, a contrary theory began to gain ground. In 1988 James S. Coleman wrote an article in the American Journal of Sociology titled \"Social Capital in the Creation of Human Capital\", the article challenged the dominance of the concept of 'self-interest' in economics and introduced the concept of social capital into the measurement of value.[10]\n\nThere was a new form of pressure applied, acting in a coalition with environmental groups: using the leveraging power of collective investors to encourage companies and capital markets to incorporate environmental and social risks and opportunities into their decision-making.\n\nAlthough the concept of selective investment was not a new one, with the demand side of the investment market having a long history of those wishing to control the effects of their investments, what began to develop at the turn of the 21st century was a response from the supply-side of the equation. At the time, this field was typically referred to as ethical or socially responsible investment. The investment market began to pick up on the growing need for products geared towards what was becoming known as the Responsible Investor. In 1981, Freer Spreckley, the creator of Social Enterprise, published Social Audit \u2014 A Management Tool for Co-operative Working, in which he first introduced the idea of a set of internal criteria that social enterprises and other organisations should use in their annual planning and accounting. These were financial viability, social wealth creation, organisational governance, and environmental responsibility, and they became known as social accounting and auditing. Later on, in 1998, John El",

        "full_text": "Total US consumer spending accounts for over $14 trillion annually and two-thirds of the US GDP. An important subset of this spending goes toward everyday consumer packaged goods (CPG), ranging from foods and beverages to cosmetics and cleaning products. The sheer size of the CPG sector\u2014with millions of employees and trillions of dollars in annual sales\u2014makes it a critical component in efforts to build a more sustainable, inclusive economy.\n\nAbout the authors This article is a collaborative effort by Sherry Frey of NielsenIQ and Jordan Bar Am, Vinit Doshi, Anandi Malik, and Steve Noble, representing views from McKinsey\u2019s Consumer Packaged Goods Practice.\n\nCPG companies increasingly allocate time, attention, and resources to instill environmental and social responsibility into their business practices. They are also making claims about environmental and social responsibility on their product labels. The results have been evident: walk down the aisle of any grocery or drugstore these days and you\u2019re bound to see products labeled \u201cenvironmentally sustainable,\u201d \u201ceco-friendly,\u201d \u201cfair trade,\u201d or other designations related to aspects of environmental and social responsibility. Most important is what lies behind these product claims\u2014the actual contribution of such business practices to achieving goals such as reducing carbon emissions across value chains, offering fair wages and working practices to employees, and supporting diversity and inclusion. But understanding how customers respond to social and environmental claims is also important and has not been clear in the past.\n\nWhen consumers are asked if they care about buying environmentally and ethically sustainable products, they overwhelmingly answer yes: in a 2020 McKinsey US consumer sentiment survey, more than 60 percent of respondents said they\u2019d pay more for a product with sustainable packaging. A recent study by NielsenIQ found that 78 percent of US consumers say that a sustainable lifestyle is important to them. Yet many CPG executives report that one challenge to their companies\u2019 environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives is the inability to generate sufficient consumer demand for these products. There are many stories of companies launching new products incorporating ESG-related claims only to find that sales fell short of expectations.\n\nHow can both of these things be true? Do consumers really care whether products incorporate ESG-related claims? Do shoppers follow through and buy these products while standing in front of store shelves or browsing online? Do their real-life buying decisions diverge from their stated preferences? The potential costs\u2014particularly in an inflationary context\u2014of manufacturing and certifying products that make good on ESG-related claims are high. Accurately assessing demand for products that make these claims is vital as companies think about where to make ESG-related investments across their businesses. Companies should therefore be eager to better understand whether and how these types of claims influence consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions. Is a shopper more likely to purchase a product if there\u2019s an ESG-related claim printed on its package? What about multiple claims? Are some kinds of claims more resonant than others? Does a claim matter more if it\u2019s appended to a pricier product? Is it less meaningful if it comes from a big, established brand?\n\nOver the past several months, McKinsey and NielsenIQ undertook an extensive study seeking to answer these and other questions. We looked beyond the self-reported intentions of US consumers and examined their actual spending behavior\u2014tracking dollars instead of sentiment. The result, for CPG companies, is a fact-based case for bringing environmentally and socially responsible products to market as part of overall ESG strategies and commitments. Creating such products turns out to be not just a moral imperative but also a solid business decision.\n\nProducts making ESG-related claims averaged 28 percent cumulative growth over the past five-year period, versus 20 percent for products that made no such claims.\n\nTo be clear, this is only a first step in understanding the complex question of how consumers value brands and products that incorporate ESG-related claims. This work has significant limitations that merit mention at the outset.\n\nFirst, although this study examines how the sales growth of products that feature ESG-related claims fared relative to similar products without such claims, it does not demonstrate a causal relationship that definitively indicates whether consumers bought these brands because of the ESG-related claims or for other reasons. For instance, the study does not control for factors such as marketing investments, distribution, and promotional activity. It primarily explores the correlation between ESG-related claims and sales performance.\n\nSecond, McKinsey and NielsenIQ did not attempt to independently assess the veracity of ESG-related claims for th",

Yet perhaps even more influential on the rollback were the state-level organisations whose smaller members claimed the biggest benefits from the deregulatory effort.\n\nBP remains a member of the New Mexico Oil & Gas Association, the Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners Association, and the Petroleum Association of Wyoming. Shell and BP are members of the Texas Oil & Gas Association.\n\nAll of the groups campaigned aggressively for changes the New Mexico Oil & Gas Association said brought the federal regulation in line with what\u2019s \u201cappropriate\u201d to \u201cemphasise flexibility and innovation.\u201d None of the groups\u2019 names appeared in either company\u2019s reviews.\n\nMeanwhile, the Petroleum Association of Wyoming \u2015 on whose board a BP executive sits \u2015 joined a lawsuit last year to allow the leasing of public lands for oil and gas drilling without assessing the climate impacts.\n\nAmong the other major groups BP and Shell left off their reviews was the National Ocean Industries Association, which successfullylobbied the Trump administration to open up the United State\u2019s entire continental shelf to drilling.\n\nThe move would open up areas containing up to 45 billion barrels of oil \u2015 21 billion barrels of which are estimated to be economically recoverable \u2015 and jeopardise chances of meeting the Paris climate goals. A report released by the campaign group Global Witness last year found that any investment in new oil and gas fields is incompatible with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial norms, an average temperature roughly half a degree warmer than today.\n\nNOIA has also lobbied the Trump administration to exclude the wider climate impacts of oil and gas projects from being assessed as part of the process of approving major infrastructure. Earlier this year Unearthed reported that BP has lobbied in support of these changes.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s important that we continue to responsibly explore for and develop U.S. offshore resources to counter the natural decline of existing fields,\u201d a Shell spokeswoman said. \u201cIt\u2019s equally important that regulators ensure sound science can be gathered from prospective new areas to inform potential leasing and future exploration decisions.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s climate loophole\n\nThe key condition that BP and Shell say they have placed on trade groups is support for the Paris climate accord, which means backing the goal \u2015 and policies to reach it \u2015 of keeping global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees celsius. This has led Shell to walk away from one of its lobby groups and BP to quit three. Both companies have said they will seek to change some trade associations from within and identified others as being fully aligned with them on climate policy.\n\nBut two powerful lobby groups that BP and Shell publicly support \u2015 the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association and the Business Council of Australia \u2015 back the use of a controversial loophole that could slash Australia\u2019s contribution to the Paris goals.\n\nThe loophole involves using surplus carbon credits from Australia\u2019s overachievement in meeting weak emissions reduction targets it secured under the Kyoto protocol. According to an analysis of the Australian government\u2019s plans, using the credits would effectively cut the country\u2019s 2030 climate target from 26% to 14%.\n\nThe European Union has banned member states from doing this on the grounds that it threatens the integrity of the Paris Agreement and no country other than Australia is openly planning to do so. But during last year\u2019s general election, both the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association and the Business Council of Australia challenged the Labor Party for refusing to use the credits if they won.\n\nDespite this, both oil majors insist they are aligned with these groups on climate policy.\n\n\u201cDespite Australia\u2019s horrific summer of bushfires, the government has not retracted its support for Kyoto carryover credits, and nor have APPEA [or] the BCA,\u201d said Dan Gocher, a",

        "full_text": "One of BP Ventures\u2019 biggest sole investments is with a company called Calysta. BP put $30m into this firm last summer.\n\nCalysta uses microorganisms to convert methane \u2013 produced by BP \u2013 into animal feed, a technique it says will reduce the demand for land to grow food for livestock.\n\nThe company commissioned the Carbon Trust to look into the environmental impact of its product. But Carbon Trust\u2019s report found that Calysta\u2019s technique would emit far more CO2 than almost any other way of making feed, unless it used biogas to make the food.\n\nInstead of doing this, Calysta has so far partnered with BP to provide methane \u2013 a greenhouse gas \u2013 for the process. The firm is also now focusing its efforts so far on food for aquaculture, rather than livestock.\n\nWhen contacted by Unearthed, Calysta shared part of a new report from Carbon Trust on its product. This showed that in some circumstances, the product would contribute to global warming less than soy protein concentrate or insect meal. In other circumstances, however, it would contribute more.\n\nA spokesperson for Calysta said the product had other benefits beyond emissions: \u201cThe world is facing an enormous challenge: it needs more protein to feed a growing population. FeedKind is one of the very few products that can meet this demand head-on without using more of our precious green spaces; without taking more wild-caught fish out of the sea; and by using very little water.\u201d\n\n\u2018A new level of audacity\u2019\n\nOther current BP investments include the $20m it put behind the company Beyond Limits, which, like Sandy, uses artificial intelligence to find new places to drill for oil.\n\nAI has been a popular technology with oil companies. Tech giants Microsoft and Amazon use AI and computing power to help them find and access new oil deposits around the world. Google, on the other hand, announced in May that it would no longer help oil companies speed up oil and gas extraction.\n\nA BP spokesperson told Unearthed: \u201cWe expect our venturing business to play a vital role in helping achieve this as it invests in game-changing technology companies that can accelerate innovation across the entire energy spectrum.\n\n\u201cWe have invested a total of $690 million in over 50 businesses in these areas so far. Around 10% of our total investment has been into businesses operating in the traditional upstream sector as we seek to make it cleaner and more efficient.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson argued that its investments in AI fitted into the latter category and also improved safety.\n\n\u201cIt is a new level of audacity for Big Oil to team up with Big Data to find more oil and gas and call it a climate investment.\u201d\n\nBronwen Tucker, research analyst at Oil Change International, told Unearthed: \u201cOil majors have had 30 years to align their business plans with a liveable climate. Instead of doing so, they\u2019re using paper-thin claims of climate action that don\u2019t stand up to scrutiny \u2013 this is just the newest in a long line of examples.\n\n\u201cIt is however a new level of audacity for Big Oil to team up with Big Data to find more oil and gas to extract, only to turn around and try to call it a climate investment.\u201d\n\nBP Ventures has also invested in Victor, a private jet app which BP exited earlier this year after the company became insolvent.\n\nLaunchpad\n\nAs well as its venture capital unit, BP has a subsidiary called Launchpad, which is aimed at building businesses. It wants \u201cto build five billion-dollar businesses which tackle the dual energy challenge by 2025\u201d.\n\nSo far, it has invested in five companies. Three of these support the fossil fuel industry:\n\nLytt, a subsurface analytics business focused on minimising risk at oil wells\n\nStryde, a subsurface imaging company whose primary purpose is helping to explore for more oil\n\nFotech, which develops fibre optic hardware it advertises as being useful for \u201chot-tapping pipelines, leaks, perimeter intrusions, moving vehicles, industrial operations, failing mechanical components\u201d\n\nThe other two are more sustainable:\n\nOnyx, a predictive maintenance platform for the wind energy sector\n\nVYVE, a carbon management and offsetting app\n\nFellow oil companies Total, Shell, Chevron and Saudi Aramco all have their own venture capital units as well, which have similarly mixed records with their hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nShell, for example, has put money behind drones used for coal mining. Total put $56m into Booster, a petrol delivery company. Chevron has invested in a wide range of companies to help it increase the amount of oil it can get out of the ground. Saudi Aramco has bought shares in companies to help it frack difficult places.\n\nTotal renamed its venture capital unit \u2018Total Carbon Neutrality Ventures\u2019 last November, saying that the fund would now be \u201cfully dedicated to carbon neutrality\u201d.\n\nSince then, it has invested in two sustainable energy companies.\n\nShell committed last month to becoming a net zero carbon company by 2050.

An important subset of this spending goes toward everyday consumer packaged goods (CPG), ranging from foods and beverages to cosmetics and cleaning products. The sheer size of the CPG sector\u2014with millions of employees and trillions of dollars in annual sales\u2014makes it a critical component in efforts to build a more sustainable, inclusive economy.\n\nAbout the authors This article is a collaborative effort by Sherry Frey of NielsenIQ and Jordan Bar Am, Vinit Doshi, Anandi Malik, and Steve Noble, representing views from McKinsey\u2019s Consumer Packaged Goods Practice.\n\nCPG companies increasingly allocate time, attention, and resources to instill environmental and social responsibility into their business practices. They are also making claims about environmental and social responsibility on their product labels. The results have been evident: walk down the aisle of any grocery or drugstore these days and you\u2019re bound to see products labeled \u201cenvironmentally sustainable,\u201d \u201ceco-friendly,\u201d \u201cfair trade,\u201d or other designations related to aspects of environmental and social responsibility. Most important is what lies behind these product claims\u2014the actual contribution of such business practices to achieving goals such as reducing carbon emissions across value chains, offering fair wages and working practices to employees, and supporting diversity and inclusion. But understanding how customers respond to social and environmental claims is also important and has not been clear in the past.\n\nWhen consumers are asked if they care about buying environmentally and ethically sustainable products, they overwhelmingly answer yes: in a 2020 McKinsey US consumer sentiment survey, more than 60 percent of respondents said they\u2019d pay more for a product with sustainable packaging. A recent study by NielsenIQ found that 78 percent of US consumers say that a sustainable lifestyle is important to them. Yet many CPG executives report that one challenge to their companies\u2019 environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives is the inability to generate sufficient consumer demand for these products. There are many stories of companies launching new products incorporating ESG-related claims only to find that sales fell short of expectations.\n\nHow can both of these things be true? Do consumers really care whether products incorporate ESG-related claims? Do shoppers follow through and buy these products while standing in front of store shelves or browsing online? Do their real-life buying decisions diverge from their stated preferences? The potential costs\u2014particularly in an inflationary context\u2014of manufacturing and certifying products that make good on ESG-related claims are high. Accurately assessing demand for products that make these claims is vital as companies think about where to make ESG-related investments across their businesses. Companies should therefore be eager to better understand whether and how these types of claims influence consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions. Is a shopper more likely to purchase a product if there\u2019s an ESG-related claim printed on its package? What about multiple claims? Are some kinds of claims more resonant than others? Does a claim matter more if it\u2019s appended to a pricier product? Is it less meaningful if it comes from a big, established brand?\n\nOver the past several months, McKinsey and NielsenIQ undertook an extensive study seeking to answer these and other questions. We looked beyond the self-reported intentions of US consumers and examined their actual spending behavior\u2014tracking dollars instead of sentiment. The result, for CPG companies, is a fact-based case for bringing environmentally and socially responsible products to market as part of overall ESG strategies and commitments. Creating such products turns out to be not just a moral imperative but also a solid business decision.\n\nProducts making ESG-related claims averaged 28 percent cumulative growth over the past five-year period, versus 20 percent for products that made no such claims.\n\nTo be clear, this is only a first step in understanding the complex question of how consumers value brands and products that incorporate ESG-related claims. This work has significant limitations that merit mention at the outset.\n\nFirst, although this study examines how the sales growth of products that feature ESG-related claims fared relative to similar products without such claims, it does not demonstrate a causal relationship that definitively indicates whether consumers bought these brands because of the ESG-related claims or for other reasons. For instance, the study does not control for factors such as marketing investments, distribution, and promotional activity. It primarily explores the correlation between ESG-related claims and sales performance.\n\nSecond, McKinsey and NielsenIQ did not attempt to independently assess the veracity of ESG-related claims for th",

Yet perhaps even more influential on the rollback were the state-level organisations whose smaller members claimed the biggest benefits from the deregulatory effort.\n\nBP remains a member of the New Mexico Oil & Gas Association, the Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners Association, and the Petroleum Association of Wyoming. Shell and BP are members of the Texas Oil & Gas Association.\n\nAll of the groups campaigned aggressively for changes the New Mexico Oil & Gas Association said brought the federal regulation in line with what\u2019s \u201cappropriate\u201d to \u201cemphasise flexibility and innovation.\u201d None of the groups\u2019 names appeared in either company\u2019s reviews.\n\nMeanwhile, the Petroleum Association of Wyoming \u2015 on whose board a BP executive sits \u2015 joined a lawsuit last year to allow the leasing of public lands for oil and gas drilling without assessing the climate impacts.\n\nAmong the other major groups BP and Shell left off their reviews was the National Ocean Industries Association, which successfullylobbied the Trump administration to open up the United State\u2019s entire continental shelf to drilling.\n\nThe move would open up areas containing up to 45 billion barrels of oil \u2015 21 billion barrels of which are estimated to be economically recoverable \u2015 and jeopardise chances of meeting the Paris climate goals. A report released by the campaign group Global Witness last year found that any investment in new oil and gas fields is incompatible with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial norms, an average temperature roughly half a degree warmer than today.\n\nNOIA has also lobbied the Trump administration to exclude the wider climate impacts of oil and gas projects from being assessed as part of the process of approving major infrastructure. Earlier this year Unearthed reported that BP has lobbied in support of these changes.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s important that we continue to responsibly explore for and develop U.S. offshore resources to counter the natural decline of existing fields,\u201d a Shell spokeswoman said. \u201cIt\u2019s equally important that regulators ensure sound science can be gathered from prospective new areas to inform potential leasing and future exploration decisions.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s climate loophole\n\nThe key condition that BP and Shell say they have placed on trade groups is support for the Paris climate accord, which means backing the goal \u2015 and policies to reach it \u2015 of keeping global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees celsius. This has led Shell to walk away from one of its lobby groups and BP to quit three. Both companies have said they will seek to change some trade associations from within and identified others as being fully aligned with them on climate policy.\n\nBut two powerful lobby groups that BP and Shell publicly support \u2015 the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association and the Business Council of Australia \u2015 back the use of a controversial loophole that could slash Australia\u2019s contribution to the Paris goals.\n\nThe loophole involves using surplus carbon credits from Australia\u2019s overachievement in meeting weak emissions reduction targets it secured under the Kyoto protocol. According to an analysis of the Australian government\u2019s plans, using the credits would effectively cut the country\u2019s 2030 climate target from 26% to 14%.\n\nThe European Union has banned member states from doing this on the grounds that it threatens the integrity of the Paris Agreement and no country other than Australia is openly planning to do so. But during last year\u2019s general election, both the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association and the Business Council of Australia challenged the Labor Party for refusing to use the credits if they won.\n\nDespite this, both oil majors insist they are aligned with these groups on climate policy.\n\n\u201cDespite Australia\u2019s horrific summer of bushfires, the government has not retracted its support for Kyoto carryover credits, and nor have APPEA [or] the BCA,\u201d said Dan Gocher, a",

        "full_text": "BP lobbied the Trump administration to weaken a landmark environmental law so that it would be harder to block major new oil and gas projects on climate change grounds, Unearthed can reveal.\n\nEarlier this month President Trump announced sweeping changes to the 50-year old National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which he blames for holding back major infrastructure projects such as roads and new oil pipelines.\n\nIn recent years initiatives including the Keystone XL oil pipeline and government auctions of oil and gas leases have been delayed by federal judges on the grounds that their climate impacts have not been adequately assessed under NEPA.\n\nDocuments seen by Unearthed now reveal that BP, together with its powerful trade association, the American Petroleum Institute (API), lobbied the White House to reform NEPA so that the climate impacts of major fossil fuel projects largely fall outside its scope.\n\nIt shows what a lie the industry\u2019s public claims are that they care about climate\n\nIn an August 2018 letter to the White House, BP welcomed Trump\u2019s plans to overhaul the regulations and endorsed a controversial set of proposals put forward in a separate letter by the API.\n\nThe API\u2019s letter demanded fundamental changes to NEPA, including a request to exclude the wider climate impacts of oil and gas projects from being assessed as part of the process of approving major infrastructure.\n\nMany of these changes have been adopted by the White House, in a proposed new set of regulations that seek to exclude so-called \u2018downstream\u2019 emissions \u2013 such as the emissions from cars burning fuel from a new oil and gas lease \u2013 from the environmental assessment process.\n\nResponding to the news, US Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) told Unearthed: \u201cIt\u2019s clear the fossil fuel industry calls the shots for Donald Trump. Whether it\u2019s swapping out the Clean Power Plan for a do-nothing rule, freezing fuel economy standards for cars, or gutting methane pollution limits, the Trump administration proposes rollbacks and fossil fuel handouts ripped straight from industry talking points.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow we learn that Big Oil asked the administration to exclude the consideration of climate and other cumulative effects in environmental reviews. That\u2019s shameful, but it\u2019s no surprise. And it shows what a lie the industry\u2019s public claims are that they care about climate; that they\u2019re \u2018on it,\u2019\u201d the Senator continued.\n\nClimate impacts\n\nA spokesman for BP told Unearthed: \u201cBP strongly supports NEPA and has been working with the environmental and business community to ensure its continued effectiveness.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither BP nor API advocated to exclude all indirect [greenhouse gas] impacts from NEPA analysis. In fact, BP believes the NEPA analysis should include all direct and many indirect impacts,\u201d he continued.\n\nThat\u2019s not legal and that\u2019s not what NEPA is for\n\nA spokesman for API said: \u201cSome courts have required agencies to consider greenhouse gas emissions beyond the footprint of a project, finding such emissions to be reasonably foreseeable and reasonably related to the project, and the proposed rule does nothing to alter that analysis.\u201d\n\nBut Nathaniel Shoaff, a senior attorney at Sierra Club, said: \u201cIf the oil industry right now is pretending that the impacts of the proposed rule changes are going to be minimal they\u2019re being totally disingenuous, because I\u2019m 100% certain that those same oil companies are going to be in court\u2026 arguing the exact opposite, which is that the new changes mean that you don\u2019t have to look at downstream uses of oil, gas and coal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey know exactly what these changes are designed to do because they\u2019re the ones asking the government to change them,\u201d he continued.",
